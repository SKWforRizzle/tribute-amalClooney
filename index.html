            <h3 class="quote-title">Advice from HER for young women:</h3>
            <p class="quote-content"><em>"It’s the courage of the people I represent. It’s also my students. I see a generation that is not only much more politically engaged than I ever was at their age, but also one that sees themselves as agents of change. That gives me hope because they’re the ones we have to rely on in the future. To young women, I would say: Reach for the stars and believe in yourselves, and know that the only thing you can regret is not trying. A lot of success is down to luck and hard work, but it’s also down to having the courage to go for it. Even if you don’t know if you can do it. Even if you’ve never done it before. Even if you don’t know anyone who’s done it. Just shifting your thinking away from 'Why me?' and instead to 'Why not me?'”</em></p>
